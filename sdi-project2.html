<p>This week I am still on the golf course enjoying my self.  I have played through the first 5 holes. Using different clubs depending on the golf hole. Also keeping in mind that this game is played out side so keeping the weather in mind.</p>
<p>The game of golf is played in the great outdoors. Every one must have their own golf clubs 14 including the putter. The object of the game is to get the ball in the hole with the lease amount of strokes as possible. Three types of holes par 3's, par 4's, and par 5's. par is when you get ball in the hole with 4 strokes on a par 4 and so on. </p>
